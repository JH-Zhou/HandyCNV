\title{Title compare_gene
Do comparison of genes between two annotated gene frequency list. The default genelist file was generate by call_gene function.
If the users customize the genelists, it requires at least two columns in each gene list, including fixed column names name2(Gene name) and Frequency(frequency of gene)}
