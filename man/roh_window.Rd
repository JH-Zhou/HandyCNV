\arguments{
\item{roh}{roh file from plink results, or generated by cnv_clean for CNVPartition results}

\item{window_size}{the length of sliding windows for dividing the chromosome, the unit is Mb}

\item{length_autosomal}{Important, total autosomal length of the corresponding species, used in calculated the F_ROH}

\item{threshold}{the proportion used in the roh windows distribution plot. For example 1000 samples, if threshold set as 0.5,
and 1000*0.5 = 500, the value of histogram above 500 will be color as red and the group below 500 will filling with other color}

\item{folder}{set name of new created folder}

\item{col_higher}{set the color of bar which frequency higher than threshold in high frequent ROH plot}

\item{col_lower}{set the color of bar which frequency lower than threshold in high frequent ROH plot}

\item{height_1}{set the height of final high frequent ROH plot}

\item{width_1}{set the width of final high frequent ROH plot}
}
